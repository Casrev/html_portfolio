<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently holding a position of engineering technician on a manufacturing company. 
    I have a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering taken up from MSEUF. 
    I was also licensed by the Professional Regulation Commission as a registered  master electrician. 
    My duties include the mechanical and electrical work in our area or division.
